
Problem:
Suppose you're on a game show, and you're given the choice of n doors.
Behind one door is a car; behind the others, goats.
You pick a door, say No. 1, and the host, who knows what's behind the doors, opens n-2 another doors, which has a goat.
Finally you are left with 2 doors one containing car and the other containing goat.
What is the probability p that you will win the car if you switch you choice to another door?

Explanation:

Let us consider the value of n as 3.
There are three doors. Behind one door is a car and behind other two is goat. Suppose you choose the door 1. 
The game host now opens a door which has a goat ( say door 2).
Now you are left with two doors. Behind one is a car and behind other is a goat.
Is it smart choice to switch? The answer is yes. 
In this case the probability of winning the car after switching is 2/3.
If there are n doors initially, the probablity of winning the car after switching is (n-1)/n which is quite large for large values of n.

Consider the case for 3 doors.
Initially, before the host opens any door, the probability of each door having a car behind it is 1/3.
Suppose you choose the door 1. Now the probability of having a car in the other two doors is 2/3.
The host has now shown you that the door 2 contains a goat. So this entire probability 2/3 now gets concentrated on door 3 and the probability for door 1 remains 1/3.
This explanation can similarly be extended for n doors.


Let us extend it for a case where k doors out of n are revealed by the host.
n doors, k revealed
Suppose we have n doors, with a car behind one of them. The probability of choosing the door with the car behind it on your first pick, is 1/n.

Monty then opens k doors, where 0≤k≤n−2 (he has to leave your original door and at least one other door closed).

The probability of picking the car if you choose a different door, is the chance of not having picked the car in the first place, which is (n−1)/n, times the probability of picking it now, which is 1/(n−k−1). This gives us a total probability of
(n-1)/(n*(n-k-1))

Solution:

#include <stdio.h>
#include <string.h>



int main()
{
	int t;
	scanf("%d",&t);
	while(t--)
	{
		int n;
		scanf("%d",&n);
		printf("%d\n",n-1);

	}
	return 0;
}

Tester Code :

#include <bits/stdc++.h>

using namespace std;

int main()
{
	int t;
	cin>>t;
	while(t--)
	{
		int n;
		cin>>n;
		assert(n>=3 && n<=100000);
		cout<<n-1<<endl;
	}
